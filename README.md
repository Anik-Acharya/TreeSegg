## Project Description

TreeSegg is a project focused on using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to segment point cloud data, enabling the detection of individual trees in a forest. By extracting geometric features such as tree height, crown diameter, and Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), the project provides valuable data for calculating AGB. Understanding AGB is vital for comprehending the carbon cycle of trees and improving forest planning and management.

## Features

- **DBSCAN Algorithm**: Used for segmenting point cloud data to detect individual trees.
- **Geometric Feature Extraction**: Extracts features like tree height, crown diameter, and DBH for each segmented tree.
- **Above Ground Biomass (AGB) Calculation**: Provides data that can be used to calculate AGB, essential for understanding the carbon cycle and forest management.
